# IAM Notes

## Types

- Users (think people)
- Groups (collection of users)
- Roles (list of permissions)
- Policy (defines one or more permissions)

## Requests have

- Action
- Resource
- Principle
- Environment Data
- Resource Data

## Web Identity Federation

- authenticate via identity providers like Amazon, Facebook, Google
- web id token exchanged for IAM role
- uses Cognito, great for mobile apps

## Cognito User Pools

- user pools
  - user logs into pool
  - pool access Id provider to get JWT
  - JWT is exchanged for AWS credentials
- identity pool
  - unique identities
- uses push notification for user data changes to all devices

## Policies

- managed policies
  - create and administrated by AWS
  - normal common use cases
  - cannot be changed by users
- customer managed policies
  - created by users
  - can only be used in the account it was created in
- inline policies
  - associated with a user, group or role
  - used to make sure the policy is not assigned to more than user, group or role

## STS - Security Token Service

- AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity
  - used with id providers (Facebook, Google, GitHub, etc...)
  - returns temp security credentials for mobile or web apps
  - JWT from id provider => assumerole-with-web-identity to STS returns temp credentials => access AWS resoure with temp credentials
  - temp credentials last for 1 hour

## Cross Acount Access

- multiple AWS accounts (dev and test vs production)
- use same ID, but allow selection of account to log into

- Account A

  - Create policy, create own. Policy allows access to shared resources.
  - Create cross account access role "MyDevelopersAccess" to give access to resources in A, attach policy created above.

- Account B

  - Create Group GroupA
  - Create inline custom policy
    ```
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
        "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::PRODUCTION-ACCOUNT-ID:role/MyDevelopersAccess"
      }
    }
    ```
  - This gives members of GroupA access to the resources in Account A, MyDevelopersAccess

- Account "Switch Roles" to MyDeveloperAccess to access those resources.
